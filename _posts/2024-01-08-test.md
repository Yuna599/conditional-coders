# All About Conditions

### **Conditional Statements**: 
There are many types of statements that all help do different things depending on the amount of values, answers and etc..

If Statements: Checks if a condition is true and then executes something. 
- For example: If it's raining, take an umbrella

Branch Statements: Provides multiple options depending on the condition.
- For example: If it's raining, take an umbrella, if not wear sunglasses.

If-Else Statements: Checks if a condition is true or false and then provides an execution for both. "If" checks if something is true. "Else" checks if something is false.
- For example: If you bought a membership the program will print "Welcome in."
If you didn't buy a membership the program will print "Invalid Membership"

Else-If Statements: Checks Multiple conditions first if they are true and if not does the final condition
- For Example: If you are younger then 10: You get a popsicle
If you are you 10 or older but not older then 20: You get a sandwhich
If you are older or 20: You get to choose whatever you want to eat
